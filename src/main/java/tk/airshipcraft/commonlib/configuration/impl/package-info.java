/**
 * <p>Provides the classes necessary for managing player preferences within a Bukkit plugin.
 * The preference system allows for persistent storage and retrieval of player-specific settings,
 * which can be used across different plugins.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Classes:</h2>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>{@link tk.airshipcraft.commonlib.configuration.impl.PlayerPreference}</b>: An abstract class that
 *   provides basic implementations of the {@link tk.airshipcraft.commonlib.configuration.IPlayerPreference} interface
 *   methods and handles the reflection logic for annotated fields with the {@link tk.airshipcraft.commonlib.configuration.PlayerPref} annotation.</li>
 *
 *   <li><b>{@link tk.airshipcraft.commonlib.configuration.impl.PreferenceProcessor}</b>: A utility class that
 *   contains static methods to load and save annotated fields from and to both a file configuration
 *   and a MySQL database using reflection.</li>
 *
 *   <li><b>{@link tk.airshipcraft.commonlib.configuration.impl.PreferencesManager}</b>: Manages all player preferences,
 *   providing methods to register, load, save, and reset preferences, as well as to describe them for
 *   individual players.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Usage:</h2>
 * <p>To use the preference system, a plugin developer must create a class that implements the
 * {@link tk.airshipcraft.commonlib.configuration.IPlayerPreference} interface and use the
 * {@link tk.airshipcraft.commonlib.configuration.PlayerPref} annotation to mark which fields
 * should be managed. The {@link tk.airshipcraft.commonlib.configuration.impl.PreferencesManager} is then
 * used to handle these preferences.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Usage example in another plugin:</h2>
 * <pre>{@code
 * public class MyPluginPlayerPreferences implements IPlayerPreference {
 *
 *     @PlayerPref(defaultValue = "defaultTown")
 *     private String townName;
 *
 *     @PlayerPref(defaultValue = "defaultNation")
 *     private String nationName;
 *
 *     // Constructor, getters and setters, and other methods...
 *
 *     @Override
 *     public void load(Player player) {
 *         // Logic to load preferences (potentially using reflection to read annotated fields)
 *     }
 *
 *     @Override
 *     public void save(Player player) {
 *         // Logic to save preferences (potentially using reflection to write annotated fields)
 *     }
 *
 *     @Override
 *     public void reset(Player player) {
 *         // Logic to reset preferences to defaults
 *     }
 *
 *     @Override
 *     public String describe(Player player) {
 *         // Return a description of all the player's preferences
 *         return "Town: " + townName + ", Nation: " + nationName;
 *     }
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>The {@link tk.airshipcraft.commonlib.commands.PreferenceCommand} can be used as a template for
 * creating commands that interact with the player preferences, allowing players to set and view
 * their preferences in-game.</p>
 *
 * <p>Please note that the reflection-based operations require careful exception handling and validation
 * to ensure data integrity and plugin stability.</p>
